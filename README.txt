iPhoto plugin for XBMC
======================
This plugin imports an iPhoto library into XBMC.  After importing, you will
see three categories that correspond with their iPhoto counterparts:

* Events
* Albums
* Ratings

Configuration
=============
The plugin needs to know where your AlbumData.xml file is.  If you haven't
explicitly pointed iPhoto to a non-standard library location, the default of
"~/Pictures/iPhoto Library/AlbumData.xml" should work fine.  Otherwise,
please enter in the correct path in the plugin's settings dialog.

The iPhoto plugin can also be configured to ignore certain album types.
It is currently hard-coded to ignore albums of type "Book" and
"Selected Event Album," but you can choose to ignore also:

* Published -- these are albums pushed to your MobileMe Gallery.
* Flagged -- albums flagged in iPhoto's interface.

Both of these album types are ignored by default.

Known Issues
============
* When importing the library, XBMC will say the script failed.  This is
  erroneous and can be ignored, but there is no way to distinguish a real
  failure from the expected one at the moment.
* You need to re-import the library every time you modify it with iPhoto.
* Currently only works on MacOS X.  Once (if?) pysqlite2 module is in the
  addons repo I'll try to port this to Windows and Linux too.
* Currently only has English strings.
* It is unknown if this plugin will work with Apple's Aperature, because I
  don't own a copy.
